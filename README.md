### Navigation

In this technique project we’re going to take a close look at navigation in SwiftUI – how we move from one screen to another using NavigationStack, both because the user asked for it and also because we want to do it automatically at a specific time.

Once we've covered those basics, we're going to look at more advanced navigation, including handling state restoration – remembering exactly where the user had navigated to, so when your app launches in the future they can pick up where they left off.
